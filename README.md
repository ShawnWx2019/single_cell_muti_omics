## GO enrichment analysis of proteins enriched in GCP and MCP.

The GO enrichment analysis and visualize of GCP and MCP was performed by [ClusterProfiler V4.0.2](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler). R package [org.At.tair.db v 3.14](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.At.tair.db.html) were used as the orgDb of *Arabidopsis thaliana*.  


## The GO analysis of proteomes of *DR5 rev::GFP* and *pOs01g0248900::VENUS-N7* root cells

The GO enrichment analysis was performed by [agrigo](http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/). For *DR5 rev::GFP* the *arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10* GO annotation was used as the GO background. For *pOs01g0248900::VENUS-N7* the *Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (Rice)* GO annotation was used as the GO background. The GO term redundancy was removed by [REViGO](http://revigo.irb.hr/), besides, a GO term network was generated by REViGO. The .xgmml file were convert into .graphml by **cytoscape v3.9.0**. And the final network were generated by **gephi v0.92**. 

## PCA and Heatmap of metabolomics

Raw peak area was used as the input data of PCA. and R package [PCAtools](https://github.com/kevinblighe/PCAtools) were used as the PCA analysis and visualize. 
[ComplexHeatmap](https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap) was used to generate the heatmap.
